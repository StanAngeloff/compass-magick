This is a list of all the nice-to-have features:

* Center gradients vertically and horizontally when angle % 90
* Composite Magick images together so you can build one image and re-use it
  in as many places as required. This should also be useful for effects such
  as overlay, screen, hard light, etc.
* Using the above, implement a function that does drop-shadow
* Support for loading external images and composing these on top of Magick
  images (with support for modes so we can have masks)
* Crop operation to select only a piece of the generated image
* border-image?
