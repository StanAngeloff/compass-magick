This is a list of all the nice-to-have features:

* drop-shadow? It should be possible to copy the image, convert it to B&W,
  apply blur + offset and then `magick-composite` with source
* border-image? It should work with a very long combination of
  `magick-composite` commands
* Crop operation to select only a piece of the generated/composited image
* Figure out how to do unit tests
* Center gradients vertically and horizontally when angle % 90
