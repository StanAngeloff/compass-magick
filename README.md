Compass Magick
==============

Dynamic image generation for Compass using ChunkyPNG (no dependency on RMagick, hooray!)

**THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BRANCH.**

At this time the code can generate Base64 encoded images only with full support for linear gradients.  
Rounded corners have not been implemented yet (although all of the required components have been added).

Watch this space for more updates.
